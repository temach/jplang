## Running locally

Install apache with mod_wsgi and mod_oidc, install python, install python requirements.
Then run:
```
# cd backend
# apachectl -f $(pwd)/apache2.conf -DFOREGROUND
```

Alternatively to view/debug the frontend run the python-only version:
```
# cd backend
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python main.py
```

To run on specific port use:
```
# python main.py --port=8001
```

You can change default port using MOONSPEAK_PORT env variable.

Graph loads all sub components in iframes. 
There is a mapping between component name and its iframe src.

When running on localhost, graph uses the config/graph.xml file, right now the mapping is as follows:
```
<iframe name="workelements" src="http://moonspeak.test:8040">
<iframe name="suggestions" src="http://moonspeak.test:8042">
<iframe name="synonyms" src="http://moonspeak.test:8043">
```
So make sure to start each sub component on the appropriate port, e.g. workelements on port 8040, submit on port 8041.


When running in docker compose, the config/graph.xml is passed as an environment variable, see docker-compose.override.yml
